## About

A Javascript widget for Parson's puzzles and related code-line-oriented
learning challenges, plus a web server for tracking progress and a generator to
create puzzles in several genres.

Puzzles are defined as a solution (working code) plus optionally some
distractors (extra lines of code that aren't necessary).

(all of that is of course currently aspirational...)
